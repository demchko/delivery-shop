# Delivery Shop
Main technologies - React JS, Redux ToolKit, Chakra UI, Firebase\n
💻A simple website for food delivery, with the possibility of registration and login, thanks to firebase, also the goods that were added to the carts are added to localStorage, so that the data is not lost after the page is closed.  
❇️Also, the project allowed me to practice with the useContext() hook, I used it to get and change the state of the modal window
